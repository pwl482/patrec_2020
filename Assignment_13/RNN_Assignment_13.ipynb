Ajusting remaining training hyperparameters like epochs, latent dimensionality or even batch size into different directions did not contradict our observation that RNN/LSTM networks with fewer layers performed better.\n",

        "  - Short sequence lengths (less than 5) produced well structured but nonsense text. For short sequence lengths the LSTM needed significantly more epochs to produce paragraph-structured text than the VanillaRNN\n",
        "  - With longer sequence lengths both networks produced better text regarding structure and reability. From length 10 and up the LSTM seemed to produce dialgue text just as fast as VanillaRNN (i.e. paragraph-structured text with capital name headings)\n",

        "Changing the batch size: no huge differences\n",

        "Overall we did not observe a huge difference between the VanillaRNN and the LSTM in our experiments. There were some runs where it seemed like the RNN actually was a littler faster in learning the training text structure (i.e. paragraphs of dialogue) while the LSTM on average needed a few more epochs to jump from newline-structured into paragraph-structured text. Also it seemed like in contrast to LSTM, the RNN still had issues with the rules of upper and lower case characters within words in the final training epochs. Readbility was sometimes hard to assess since Shakespearian english might from time to tiem appear even to native speakers as unreadable. Judging from the pattern Elizabethan vocabulary follows, bith networks perform well in reproduction with only a few layers and short training sequence lengths. Yet, both networks did not learn to produce good sentence structure and readability in terms of context. \n"
